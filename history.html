                <h2>History of India</h2>
                <h4>
                    According to consensus in modern genetics, anatomically modern humans first arrived on the Indian subcontinent from
                    Africa between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago. However, the earliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years
                    ago. Settled life, which involves the transition from foraging to farming and pastoralism, began in South Asia around
                    7,000 BCE. At the site of Mehrgarh presence can be documented of the domestication of wheat and barley, rapidly followed
                    by that of goats, sheep, and cattle. By 4,500 BCE, settled life had spread more widely, and began to gradually evolve
                    into the Indus Valley Civilization, an early civilization of the Old world, which was contemporaneous with Ancient Egypt
                    and Mesopotamia. This civilisation flourished between 2,500 BCE and 1900 BCE in what today is Pakistan and north-western
                    India, and was noted for its urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage, and water supply.<br><br>
                    
                    In early second millennium BCE persistent drought caused the population of the Indus Valley to scatter from large urban
                    centres to villages. Around the same time, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of
                    migration. Their Vedic period (1500-500 BCE) was marked by the composition of the Vedas, large collections of hymns of
                    these tribes. Their varna system, which evolved into the caste system, consisted of a hierarchy of priests, warriors,
                    and free peasants. The pastoral and nomadic Indo-Aryans spread from the Punjab into the Gangetic plain, large swaths of
                    which they deforested for agriculture usage. The composition of Vedic texts ended around 600 BCE, when a new,
                    interregional culture arose. Small chieftaincies, or janapadas, were consolidated into larger states, or mahajanapadas,
                    and a second urbanisation took place. This urbanisation was accompanied by the rise of new ascetic movements in Greater
                    Magadha, including Jainism and Buddhism, which opposed the growing influence of Brahmanism and the primacy of rituals,
                    presided by Brahmin priests, that had come to be associated with Vedic religion, and gave rise to new religious
                    concepts. In response to the success of these movements, Vedic Brahmanism was synthesised with the preexisting religious
                    cultures of the subcontinent, giving rise to Hinduism.<br><br>
                    
                    Most of the Indian subcontinent was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. From the 3rd
                    century BCE onwards Prakrit and Pali literature in the north and the Tamil Sangam literature in southern India started
                    to flourish. Wootz steel originated in south India in the 3rd century BCE and was exported to foreign countries. During
                    the Classical period, various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties for the next 1,500 years, among which the
                    Gupta Empire stands out. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as the
                    classical or "Golden Age of India". During this period, aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and
                    religion (Hinduism and Buddhism) spread to much of Asia, while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links
                    with the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Indian cultural influence spread over many parts of Southeast Asia, which
                    led to the establishment of Indianised kingdoms in Southeast Asia (Greater India).<br><br>
                    
                    The most significant event between the 7th and 11th century was the Tripartite struggle centred on Kannauj that lasted
                    for more than two centuries between the Pala Empire, Rashtrakuta Empire, and Gurjara-Pratihara Empire. Southern India
                    saw the rise of multiple imperial powers from the middle of the fifth century, most notably the Chalukya, Chola,
                    Pallava, Chera, Pandyan, and Western Chalukya Empires. The Chola dynasty conquered southern India and successfully
                    invaded parts of Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Bengal in the 11th century. In the early medieval period
                    Indian mathematics, including Hindu numerals, influenced the development of mathematics and astronomy in the Arab
                    world.<br><br>
                    
                    Islamic conquests made limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Sindh as early as the 8th century, followed by the
                    invasions of Mahmud Ghazni. The Delhi Sultanate was founded in 1206 CE by Central Asian Turks who ruled a major part of
                    the northern Indian subcontinent in the early 14th century, but declined in the late 14th century, and saw the advent of
                    the Deccan sultanates. The wealthy Bengal Sultanate also emerged as a major power, lasting over three centuries. This
                    period also saw the emergence of several powerful Hindu states, notably Vijayanagara and Rajput states, such as Mewar.
                    The 15th century saw the advent of Sikhism. The early modern period began in the 16th century, when the Mughal Empire
                    conquered most of the Indian subcontinent, signalling the proto-industrialization, becoming the biggest global economy
                    and manufacturing power, with a nominal GDP that valued a quarter of world GDP, superior than the combination of
                    Europe's GDP. The Mughals suffered a gradual decline in the early 18th century, which provided opportunities for the
                    Marathas, Sikhs, Mysoreans, Nizams, and Nawabs of Bengal to exercise control over large regions of the Indian
                    subcontinent.<br><br>
                    
                    From the mid-18th century to the mid-19th century, large regions of India were gradually annexed by the East India
                    Company, a chartered company acting as a sovereign power on behalf of the British government. Dissatisfaction with
                    company rule in India led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which rocked parts of north and central India, and led to the
                    dissolution of the company. India was afterwards ruled directly by the British Crown, in the British Raj. After World
                    War I, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched by the Indian National Congress, led by Mahatma Gandhi, and
                    noted for nonviolence. Later, the All-India Muslim League would advocate for a separate Muslim-majority nation state.
                    The British Indian Empire was partitioned in August 1947 into the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan, each
                    gaining its independence.

                        Hominin expansion from Africa is estimated to have reached the Indian subcontinent approximately two million years ago,
                        and possibly as early as 2.2 million years before the present. This dating is based on the known presence of Homo
                        erectus in Indonesia by 1.8 million years before the present and in East Asia by 1.36 million years before present, as
                        well as the discovery of stone tools made by proto-humans in the Soan River valley, at Riwat, and in the Pabbi Hills, in
                        present-day Pakistan. Although some older discoveries have been claimed, the suggested dates, based on the dating of
                        fluvial sediments, have not been independently verified.<br><br>
                        
                        The oldest hominin fossil remains in the Indian subcontinent are those of Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis, from the
                        Narmada Valley in central India, and are dated to approximately half a million years ago. Older fossil finds have been
                        claimed, but are considered unreliable. Reviews of archaeological evidence have suggested that occupation of the Indian
                        subcontinent by hominins was sporadic until approximately 700,000 years ago, and was geographically widespread by
                        approximately 250,000 years before the present, from which point onward, archaeological evidence of proto-human presence
                        is widely mentioned.<br><br>

                <h4>
                According to a historical demographer of South Asia, Tim Dyson:<br><br>
                    
                "Modern human beings—Homo sapiens—originated in Africa. Then, intermittently, sometime between 60,000 and 80,000 years
                ago, tiny groups of them began to enter the north-west of the Indian subcontinent. It seems likely that initially, they
                came by way of the coast. ... it is virtually certain that there were Homo sapiens in the subcontinent 55,000 years ago,
                even though the earliest fossils that have been found of them date to only about 30,000 years before the present."
                According to Michael D. Petraglia and Bridget Allchin:<br><br>
                
                "Y-Chromosome and Mt-DNA data support the colonization of South Asia by modern humans originating in Africa. ...
                Coalescence dates for most non-European populations average to between 73–55 ka."<br><br>
                
                And according to an environmental historian of South Asia, Michael Fisher:<br><br>
                
                "Scholars estimate that the first successful expansion of the Homo sapiens range beyond Africa and across the Arabian
                Peninsula occurred from as early as 80,000 years ago to as late as 40,000 years ago, although there may have been prior
                unsuccessful emigrations. Some of their descendants extended the human range ever further in each generation, spreading
                into each habitable land they encountered. One human channel was along the warm and productive coastal lands of the
                Persian Gulf and northern Indian Ocean. Eventually, various bands entered India between 75,000 years ago and 35,000
                years ago."<br><br>
                
                Archaeological evidence has been interpreted to suggest the presence of anatomically modern humans in the Indian
                subcontinent 78,000–74,000 years ago, although this interpretation is disputed. The occupation of South Asia by modern
                humans, over a long time, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has turned it into a highly
                diverse one, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.<br><br>
                
                According to Tim Dyson:<br><br>
                
                "Genetic research has contributed to knowledge of the prehistory of the subcontinent's people in other respects. In
                particular, the level of genetic diversity in the region is extremely high. Indeed, only Africa's population is
                genetically more diverse. Related to this, there is strong evidence of ‘founder’ events in the subcontinent. By this is
                meant circumstances where a subgroup—such as a tribe—derives from a tiny number of ‘original’ individuals. Further,
                compared to most world regions, the subcontinent's people are relatively distinct in having practised comparatively high
                levels of endogamy."

                        The Neolithic period is the final division of the Stone Age, with a wide-ranging set of developments that appear to have
                        arisen independently in several parts of the world. It is first seen about 12,000 years ago when the first developments
                        of farming appeared in the Epipalaeolithic Near East, and later in other parts of the world. The Neolithic lasted (in
                        that part of the world) until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic from about 6,500 years ago (4500 BC), marked
                        by the development of metallurgy, leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age.<br><br>
                        
                        In other places the Neolithic followed the Mesolithic and then lasted until later. In Northern Europe, the Neolithic
                        lasted until about 1700 BC, while in China it lasted until circa 2000 BC with the rise of the pre-Shang Erlitou culture.
                        Other parts of the world (including Oceania and the northern regions of the Americas) remained broadly in the Neolithic
                        stage of development until European contact.<br><br>
                        
                        The Neolithic introduced the Neolithic Revolution or "Neolithic package", comprising a progression of behavioral and
                        cultural characteristics and changes, above all the introduction of farming and use of domesticated animals.The term Neolithic is modern, based on Greek νέος néos 'new' and λίθος líthos 'stone', literally 'New Stone Age'. The
                        term was coined by Sir John Lubbock in 1865 as a refinement of the three-age system.

                    Settled life, encompassing the transition from foraging to farming and pastoralism, began in South Asia in the region of
                    Balochistan, Pakistan, around 7,000 BC. At the site of Mehrgarh, Balochistan, presence can be documented of the
                    domestication of wheat and barley, rapidly followed by that of goats, sheep, and cattle. In April 2006, it was announced
                    in the scientific journal Nature that the oldest (and first early Neolithic) evidence for the drilling of teeth in vivo
                    (using bow drills and flint tips) was found in Mehrgarh.<br><br>
                    
                    In South India, the Neolithic began by 6500 BC and lasted until around 1400 BC when the Megalithic transition period
                    began. South Indian Neolithic is characterized by Ash mounds[clarification needed] from 2500 BC in Karnataka region,
                    expanded later to Tamil Nadu.<br><br>
                    
                    In East Asia, the earliest sites include the Nanzhuangtou culture around 9500–9000 BC, Pengtoushan culture around
                    7500–6100 BC, and Peiligang culture around 7000–5000 BC. The prehistoric Beifudi site near Yixian in Hebei Province,
                    China, contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the Cishan and Xinglongwa cultures of about 6000–5000 BC,
                    Neolithic cultures east of the Taihang Mountains, filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese
                    cultures. The total excavated area is more than 1,200 square yards (1,000 m2; 0.10 ha), and the collection of Neolithic
                    findings at the site encompasses two phases.<br><br>
                    
                    The 'Neolithic' (defined in this paragraph as using polished stone implements) remains a living tradition in small and
                    extremely remote and inaccessible pockets of West Papua (Indonesian New Guinea). Polished stone adze and axes are used
                    in the present day (as of 2008) in areas where the availability of metal implements is limited. This is likely to cease
                    altogether in the next few years as the older generation die off and steel blades and chainsaws prevail.<br><br>
                    
                    In 2012, news was released about a new farming site discovered in Munam-ri, Goseong, Gangwon Province, South Korea,
                    which may be the earliest farmland known to date in east Asia.[48] "No remains of an agricultural field from the
                    Neolithic period have been found in any East Asian country before, the institute said, adding that the discovery reveals
                    that the history of agricultural cultivation at least began during the period on the Korean Peninsula". The farm was
                    dated between 3600 and 3000 BC. Pottery, stone projectile points, and possible houses were also found. "In 2002,
                    researchers discovered prehistoric earthenware, jade earrings, among other items in the area". The research team will
                    perform accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating to retrieve a more precise date for the site.
